Amitasya is a personal portfolio project created to showcase my skills, creativity, and passion for building immersive web experiences. The name Amitasya is derived from Sanskrit, meaning “of the limitless” or “belonging to the infinite,” and reflects both the essence of my name, Amit, and my mindset as a developer.

This project represents my ongoing journey of exploration, learning, and pushing creative and technical boundaries. Through modern web technologies and interactive design, Amitasya serves as a space where experimentation meets expression — a reflection of my limitless curiosity and drive to innovate.
